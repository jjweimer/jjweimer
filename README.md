### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a senior at the University of California San Diego majoring in Political Science / Data Analytics. I enjoy using quantitative methods to solve social science problems, and aspire to have a career in data science or national security.

Here are a few things I've worked on:
- Built Synthetic Models of Afghanistan to understand the effects of U.S. Intervention on Afghan health
- Developing an App for the UCSD Data & GIS Lab which automates cleaning and visualization of library services data
- Visualized data from over 1600 of my chess games to create actionable insights
- Competed in Rubik's Cube competitions and achieved a ranking of 11th in the world
