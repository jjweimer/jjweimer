### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a senior at the University of California San Diego majoring in Political Science / Data Analytics. I enjoy using quantitative methods to solve social science problems, and aspire to have a career in data science or national security.

Here are a few things I've worked on:
- Built Synthetic Models of Afghanistan to understand the effects of U.S. Intervention on Afghan health
- Forecasted prices of stocks like AAPL, TSLA, and GME
- Competed in Rubik's Cube competitions and achieved a ranking of 11th in the world
